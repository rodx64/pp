## Open Close Principle 

#### _" Classes, modules, functions.. should be open for extension, but closed for modification"_

### The idea behind OCP is basically that you can add new functionality to an existing software system without having to change existing code.  


#### Tip
- Whenever a class uses an ENUM or there is a conditional statement, 
we should try to break into another class.
